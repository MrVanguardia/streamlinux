## �🔒 Security Features

StreamLinux implements several security measures to protect your data:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Local Network Only** | All streaming occurs over your local network (LAN). No data is sent to external servers. |
| **End-to-End Encryption** | Media streams are encrypted using DTLS-SRTP (WebRTC standard). |
| **Token Authentication** | QR code pairing uses cryptographically secure tokens (CSPRNG). |
| **Token Rotation** | Authentication tokens expire after 60 seconds and are automatically rotated. |
| **HMAC-SHA256 Signatures** | All tokens are signed to prevent tampering. |
| **No Data Collection** | We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage analytics. |
| **Open Source** | All code is publicly available for review and audit. |
